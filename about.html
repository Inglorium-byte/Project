Take your spoon and break through the surface, and suddenly, like a volcano erupting, a river of molten chocolate lava comes rushing out, creating a gooey, luscious mess that's nothing short of magical. This chocolatey eruption doesn't just flow, it dances and twirls, teasing your taste buds with every swirl.</p>

       <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.kGEOsWSuVGADX_zhscsJHwHaD3?w=326&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7" alt="Pizza image">
       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Ah, pizza! The round marvel of the culinary world, always ready to deliver joy, one slice at a time.Every bite is a bite into happiness—a blend of savory, spicy, and sometimes sweet. Your taste buds are treated to a carnival of flavors, each one performing a little number that leaves you craving an encore.</p>
       <h2 class="Q">Ingridients</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>Yeast: Active dry yeast is a leavening agent.</li>
         <li>Sugar: To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. </li>
         <li>Bread Flour: Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour.</li>
         <li>Olive Oil:  Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</li>
         <li>Salt: A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
       </ul>
       <h2 class="Q">Directions</h2>
       <ol>
         <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
         <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. </li>
         <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
         <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
         <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. </li>
         <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
         <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
         <li>Enjoy!</li>
       </ol>

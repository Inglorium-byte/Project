        <h2 id="L"> Description </h2>
        <p>Mousse is your whimsical dessert buddy who knows how to keep things light and tasty! Each spoonful feels like a serenade from a sugar-laden symphony, charming your senses and making you grin like you’re in on some delicious secret. It’s not heavy or demanding, oh no, it’s as light as a feather, and just as delightful.</p>
        <h2 class="Q">Ingridients</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>White baking chocolate</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream: Heavy whipping cream aerates the mousse and gives it that distinct creaminess.</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Mixed fresh berries (optional): While optional, the addition of mixed fresh berries creates a lovely and light contrast to the richness of this White Chocolate Mousse.</li>
           </ul>
        <h2 class="Q">Directions</h2>
           <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Prepare the mousse base.
               <p>In a small heavy saucepan, combine chocolate and 2/3 cup cream. Cook and stir the mixture over medium-low heat until smooth. Transfer it to a large bowl and cool to room temperature.</p> 
            </li>
            <li>Step 2: Whip the heavy cream.
                <p>In a small bowl, beat the remaining cream until it begins to thicken. Add sieved and powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat the mixture until soft peaks form.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 3: Fold heavy cream into chocolate mixture.
               <p>Fold 1/4 cup whipped cream into the chocolate mixture, then fold in the remaining whipped cream.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Step 4: Spoon into serving dish(es) and chill.
               <p>Refrigerate while covered, for at least two hours. If desired, garnish with berries.</p>
